# Small-Area-Datasets
## Project Overview
The purpose of this repository  is to support the development and evaluation of methods for the estimation and forecasting of small area populations by providing researchers and practitioners with small area datasets from across the globe. 

We define “small area” as datasets where most of the time series are for areas with total populations <100,000  or spatially distributed data with a resolution of 100m2 at the equator (or better).  

Our goal is to make this as accessible as possible, therefore the data and metadata are provided in csv format.

We invite demographers to contribute to this repo and to make suggestions on how to improve the way that the data is organised.  
If you would like to contribute or make suggestions please contact irina at: irina.grossman@unimelb.edu.au
